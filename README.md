Project Description
----------
This project is a multiplayer Rock,Paper,Scissors,Spock,Lizard(RPSlS) game.

I first built a one-player version of Rock,Paper,Scissors(RPS) where you played
against the computer. You can find this in branch basic-rules.  
Lastly I built a one-player version of RPSLS which you can find in master branch. Here are the rules of RPSLS http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock


Technologies used
-----------
I used basic Javascript as it was quite a simple game and I wanted to try
building something without any libraries or frameworks.   
As always there was more
complexity then first anticipated and so for similar challenge in future would
likely use a framework.
